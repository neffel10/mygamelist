			<h2>SUBMIT YOUR OWN FAVORITE SAGA</h2>
			
			<p>Is not that easy to submit a whole game series catalogue when 
			theres not page who has it organized by certain parameters and is even
			harder to got all gaming history in just a short period of time, thats
			why we upload a limited quantity of gaming sagas every month THATS WHERE
			U ENTER IN THE EQUATION!
			
			U can contact us in friendly submit formularies and we will analize 
			the content, polish and refine the structure and of course u will be
			rewarded with MGL Points and ur name forever in the catalog main page
			so we encourage you to help us as much as posible</p>
			
			<h2>WIN POINTS AND PURCHASE INTERESTING REWARDS</h2>
			
			<p>As u read before, by helping us you will win MGL points that u
			can trade for wallpapers, badges, cool stuff and even game codes!</p>
			
			<p>The core to get a lot of points is finish games series 
			and upload your proof altogether so we will verified this and then
			we will give you lots of points so u play you win and even the
			implied companies win by you buying his games like crazy everyone
